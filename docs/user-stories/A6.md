# Story A6 â€“ Album-to-Track View Toggle with Artwork

**As a** visual listener  
**I want** to browse albums with cover art but drill down into track-level stats  
**So that** I can appreciate artwork while exploring detailed listening patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Default view shows album cards with cover art, key metadata, and scrobble summary.
- Toggle expands a selected album into a track table (track number, duration, scrobbles).
- Track view includes quick navigation back to the album grid.
- High-resolution cover images are cached to avoid UI lag.
