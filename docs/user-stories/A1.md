# Story A1 â€“ Albums by Decade with Scrobble Totals

**As a** listener exploring eras  
**I want** to filter my saved albums by decade and see cumulative scrobble counts  
**So that** I understand which decades dominate my listening.

## Acceptance Criteria
- UI filter exposes decade buckets derived from release dates.
- Album list shows total scrobbles per album (from Last.fm sync).
- Sorting by scrobbles and by alphabetical order is available.
- Empty states clarify when no albums match a selected decade.
