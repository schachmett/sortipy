# Story A3 â€“ Genre-Focused Discovery

**As a** genre explorer  
**I want** to search by MusicBrainz/RYM genres and surface matching albums in my library  
**So that** I can deep dive into specific styles I enjoy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Genre taxonomy is deduplicated and presented via search/autocomplete.
- Selecting a genre filters albums where the tag matches (including multi-genre albums).
- Result list exposes key metadata: release date, scrobbles, external rating.
- Multiple genre selection (AND/OR) behavior is defined and implemented.
