# Story A5 â€“ Attribute-Driven Library Browser

**As a** power user  
**I want** a faceted browser across release date, external ratings, listening time, and album length  
**So that** I can slice my library with custom criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Filters exist for release date range, RYM rating thresholds, total listening minutes, and album duration.
- Adjusting filters updates results in real time without page reloads.
- Selected filters are displayed as removable chips/pills.
- Performance remains acceptable with full library (e.g., <200ms query response target).
