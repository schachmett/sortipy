# Story A2 â€“ Unplayed Saved Albums

**As a** collector of music  
**I want** to surface saved albums with zero scrobbles  
**So that** I can focus on unheard additions to my library.

## Acceptance Criteria
- View lists Spotify-saved albums lacking any associated scrobbles.
- Albums with partial scrobbling (e.g., one track) are excluded from this view.
- The view supports sorting by date added and release date.
- There is an action or link to start playback or mark as listened.
