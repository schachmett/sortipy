# TODOs

- [x] Wire up pre-commit hooks that run `.venv/bin/ruff check`, `.venv/bin/pyright`, and `.venv/bin/pytest`.
- [ ] Define logging policy (levels, destinations) and document expectations for agents.
- [ ] Add structured logging to sync orchestration and adapters.
- [ ] Establish an issue-tracking workflow accessible to both user and agent (no external GitHub reliance).
